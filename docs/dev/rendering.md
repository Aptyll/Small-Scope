# Rendering

Everything that draws: the camera, the pass order, the baked panels, and the pixel cursor.
Read this before touching `render()`, adding a draw pass, or changing anything positioned off
`VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H`. The hard invariants are summarised in [../../CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

## One-camera fullscreen pixel rendering

Every player gets the **same camera** (the SC2/League model): the view always shows
`TARGET_ROWS` (270) rows of world — a 1920×1080 fullscreen is exactly 480×270 at 4×, and other
monitors buy sharpness with their extra pixels, never zoom. There is deliberately **no
resolution setting**; camera zoom is a gameplay feature (below), not a display one.
`VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H` are `let`s set by `fitCanvas()`:

- It picks an integer **device**-pixel scale (via `devicePixelRatio`, so game pixels land
  exactly on device pixels even under fractional 125%/150% OS scaling) closest to
  `deviceH / TARGET_ROWS`. `scale` is fractional in CSS px and must not be floored.
- Heights that don't divide cleanly (1440p → 5×, 288 rows) **"breathe"** a few percent rather
  than letterbox or blur — the Terraria/Stardew trade. 16:9 screens always fill edge-to-edge.
- `VIEW_W` is **capped at 16:9** (`ceil(VIEW_H * 16/9)`): wider-than-16:9 monitors get pillarbox
  bars instead of extra vision — the SC2 rule. Narrower screens simply see less width. A guard
  keeps the view at least 320×240 so the UI panels always fit.
- The bars are **themed, not black**: a second full-window canvas (`#bars`, z-order under
  `#game`, `pointer-events: none`) carries a static frost-panel frame — night slab, mottling,
  ice crystals, icicle fringes on the top and bottom edges, and an icy bevel hugging the game
  view — baked by
  `renderBars()` in the game palette. It spans `FULL_W` (the pre-cap window width in game px)
  and is deliberately darker than the world so the eye stays on the game; on ≤16:9 screens it
  is cleared and fully covered. It uses `hash2`, so it must never run before boot — it is baked
  once per canvas size by `relayout()`, never per frame, and the game never draws into it.

**Scroll-wheel camera zoom** rides on the same machinery: each `zoomStep` raises the integer
device-pixel scale by one (so every level stays pixel-perfect), zoom **out** is hard-capped at
the `TARGET_ROWS` baseline (the fairness ceiling — scrolling out never buys extra vision) and
zoom **in** at `MIN_ROWS` (150) rows, so the number of steps varies per monitor (`zoomMax`, set
by `fitCanvas()`). The wheel handler only bumps `zoomStep`; `update()` applies it by diffing
against `zoomEff` and calling `fitCanvas()`/`relayout()` — overlays (map/settings) and non-play
modes force base zoom so the fixed-size panels always fit, restoring on close. The whole
presentation zooms, HUD included. `DBG.setZoom(n)`/`DBG.getZoom()` drive it externally. The
scroll wheel is zoom only — there is no tool selection to cycle.

**All game logic and drawing works in the `VIEW_W`×`VIEW_H` space** — mouse coords are divided
by `scale` on the way in. Round positions when drawing (`Math.round`) or sprites smear across
subpixels.

**Cross-file invariant:** any code path that changes the canvas size — window resize,
`fullscreenchange` — must call `fitCanvas()` then `relayout()`. `relayout()` recomputes
everything positioned off `VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H`: the minimap anchors, the map/settings panel
positions (`PANEL_X/Y`, `SET_X/Y`, `SL_X`, `ROW_*` — `let`s **declared in the `canvas` banner
beside `relayout()`**, not down in their own sections, so `relayout()` never reaches forward
into a temporal dead zone; the offsets *within* each baked panel stay fixed in their own
sections), `fitFlakes()`, which keeps snow density constant by topping up/trimming
the `flakes` array, and `renderBars()`, which re-bakes the pillarbox frame. Never write layout
code against a literal 480/270; `renderTitle()` shows the pattern for recentering a 270-authored
layout (`toy` offset).

`render()` keeps two camera offsets: tiles and other statics subtract the rounded `ox`/`oy`,
while moving entities (player, animals, robots, drops, particles, floaters, swing arc) subtract
the exact `ex`/`ey` and round once at the end. Screen pos must be `round(world - camera)` with a
**single** rounding — rounding camera and entity separately makes their boundary crossings
disagree and the sprite vibrates ±1px against the background while walking (measured 48 flips/s),
which reads as ghosting on high-refresh displays. New entity draw code must use `ex`/`ey`.

## Render pass order

`render()` runs: ground blit → under-ice fish → ice-crack decals → footprints → flat objects
(stumps) → item drops → **y-sorted
`draws` array** (tall objects + every live player + animals + robots, sorted by feet Y; empty
slots draw as team-tinted silhouettes via `drawGhost`) →
selection brackets (`drawSelection`: white pulsing corners with a dark shadow over the hovered
stump / finished structure, or the wheel's target) → the E work prompt (`drawWorkHint`) → the
fish brackets + click prompt (`drawFishHint`) → construction progress bars → particles →
arrows → turret tracers → swing arcs (one per swinging player) → floaters → `renderLighting` → `renderWeather` →
`renderVignettes` → `renderUI` → `renderWheel` (radial menu, above the UI) →
map/settings/title/death overlays → fps/seed tags → the pixel cursor (always last). The bow's
`drawAimLine` sits between the particles and the arrows pass. Anything that should be occluded by trees goes into `draws`
with a sort key; anything flat goes in the pre-pass.

Trees draw at `py - 8`, so a tree's canopy overhangs the bottom half of the tile *above* it.
Short ground sprites (rock, bush, stump) all draw at `py + 4` to stay clear of that
band — drop one lower and a tree on the tile below hides it almost completely.

Sprite hit-flash goes through `drawSpriteFlash()`, which recolours via a shared 32×32 `scratch`
canvas with `source-in` — sprites larger than 32×32 will clip.

## UI panels are baked once

`buildMapPanel()` and `buildSettingsPanel()` draw the static chrome (parchment, compass, labels)
into offscreen canvases at boot; per-frame code blits them and draws only the live parts on top.
Their layout variables (`PANEL_*`, `MAP_*`, `SET_*`, `SL_X`, `ROW_*`) are shared between the bake
function and the per-frame code, so both sides move together — but a bake-side change only appears
after the panel is rebuilt. They are declared **up in the `canvas` banner next to `relayout()`**
(which reassigns them on every canvas-size change) rather than in these sections; a new panel row
must be declared there too. The bake draws in panel-relative coordinates (e.g. `ROW_FPS - SET_Y`),
so a recenter never requires a re-bake — keep any new row's bake-side label and per-frame widget
expressed the same way.

The map panel's bake keeps a fixed 192×192 map slot; the world is bigger than that, so
`renderWorldMap()` blits `mapCv` scaled by `MAP_S = MAP_W / WORLD` and every tile-space
position drawn on top (grid lines, camera rect, player marker) must be multiplied by `MAP_S`.
The minimap needs no such factor — it is a scrolling 1px-per-tile viewport, not a whole-world
view.

## Overhead health bars

`drawHealthBar()` draws a small color-coded bar (green → amber → red by hp fraction) above every
unit, always visible: every player (in `drawPlayer`), animals (in `drawAnimal`),
and robots (in `drawRobot`).
The overhead bar is the **only** player health display — the old top-left Minecraft-style hearts
were removed in the HUD redesign (their sprites are still baked, unreferenced). While the bow is
drawn, a second small meter renders just above it: yellow while charging,
turning hot orange at full draw (two discrete states — a gradient is unreadable at 14 px) — drawn
for **everyone**, because it is the tell that a shot is coming. The overhead stack floats clear of
the sprite: stamina plate at `py - 4` (local slot only), health at `py - 7`, draw meter at
`py - 12`, and a rival's name tag in team colour above that.

## Damage feedback

`addDmgFloater(x, y, amount, taken)` pushes a combat damage number into the shared `floaters`
array: **gold** for damage dealt (arrows, whoever fired them), **red `-N`** for damage the local
player takes (`damagePlayer`). Numbers of 10+
render at 2× scale, and each gets a small random x-drift so rapid repeat hits stay readable.
Floater entries carry optional `vx`/`scale`/`rise` fields honored by the floaters render pass;
plain `addFloater` entries default to the old look. Units also flash white on hit via
`drawSpriteFlash` (0.8-alpha overlay). Hits on **structures** intentionally get no numbers;
structures show flash, shake, and damage cracks instead.

## Cursor

The native pointer is hidden over the canvas and a **pixel-art cursor is drawn in-canvas** as
the very last thing in `render()` (above every overlay and the seed tag), so it sits on the
game's pixel grid at every zoom level. `cursorInfo()` resolves the pointer state once per
frame from `mouse`, `state`, `player` (draw/flounder/roll), and what's under the pointer, and
both the pixel cursor and the browser-cursor fallback read from it. It returns
`{ kind, mode, dim, frac }`:

- `kind` **arrow** — title, dead, paused, map, and anywhere in the settings/wheel that isn't
  a widget; **hand** — over a settings widget (`settingsHit()`, shared with the click handler
  so hover and click can never disagree) or a live wheel segment; **grab** — dragging a
  slider; **hammer** — over a stump or finished structure (right-clickable; `dim` beyond the
  60 px reach); **reticle** — everywhere else in play.
- Reticle `mode` (table `RETICLE`): **idle** white cross; **lock** gold ring — E will work
  the object under the pointer (`workTarget()` is non-null: tree, rock, berried bush),
  dimmed when it is beyond `WORK_REACH`; **ice** the same lock in pale blue over bare ice;
  **hunt** amber breathing ring over an animal; **fish** water-blue ring over a fish; **bow** — while charging the ring closes as
  the draw fills and turns orange at full, like the meter. `dim` (50% alpha) also means tools
  are blocked right now: floundering in a hole, or mid-roll.
- Sprites live in `SPRITES.cursor.{arrow,hand,grab,hammer}` (`CUPAL`, lit top-left, icy
  bevel) with one-colour `SPRITES.cursorShadow` twins drawn 1 px offset beneath; hotspots are
  in `CUR_HOT`. Reticles are procedural via `drawOutlinedRects()` (dark rim pass, then fill),
  which the aim line's markers reuse.
- `settings.pixelCursor` (default **on**, the CURSOR row in the ESC menu: PIXEL/BROWSER)
  switches to the native pointer; `applyCursorStyle()` then maps the same state to the
  nearest CSS cursor (`crosshair`/`pointer`/`grabbing`/`default`) and sets
  `canvas.style.cursor` only on change. `mouse.inside` (set by mousemove, cleared by
  `mouseleave` on the canvas and document) hides the drawn cursor when the pointer leaves,
  and `DBG.hideUI` hides it for captures.

## Lighting

**Nothing currently emits light.** Campfires and torches were removed with the old hotbar, so
`rebuildLights()` just empties the `lights` array — but the whole pipeline is kept intact as
the single rebuild point for any future glowing object: `renderLighting()` punches `lights`
entries (`{x, y, r, warm}`) out of a dark overlay on the offscreen `lightCv` using
`destination-out`, then `drawWarmGlows()` adds `multiply` colour grading plus a `lighter` core.
**Any code that adds or removes a light-emitting object must call `rebuildLights()`.** The only
night light today is the player's personal glow (radius 44) baked into `renderLighting()`.
There is no warmth/cold system anymore — night darkness is purely visual.

# Working on sprites

How the ASCII-grid sprite system works and which sprites share grids with which. Read this before
editing [../../js/sprites.js](../../js/sprites.js) — note the encoding warning at the end.

Sprites are literal ASCII grids paired with a palette object mapping character → hex (or `null`
for transparent), baked by `bake()` at load. Left-facing variants are `flipH()` of the right ones.
Character sprites are 16×16; the raider set (`SPRITES.raider`, `RDPAL`) is baked from the exact
same grids as the player, so a player pose edit changes both. The tiered structures use the same
trick: one 16×16 grid each (`wall`, `turret`, `generator`, `spawner`) baked with `WPAL` /
`WPAL_STONE` / `WPAL_GOLD` into `SPRITES[type][tier]` arrays — a grid edit changes all three
tiers, and the palettes share the extra `k`/`K` (iron fitting) and `e` (glow) chars. The
construction stages are one shared `scaffold` set (`[posts, frame, lattice-overlay]`, `SCPAL`),
and the robot is the old `imp1`/`imp2` grids re-baked with the wooden `ROBPAL`. The tool-bar
icons (`itemBow`/`itemAxe`/`itemPick`) are 8×8 grids sharing `AXPAL` and are drawn at a crisp
2× in `renderUI()`. Wildlife is
side-view only — rabbits are 12×11 (sit) / 14×9 (hop), deer are 26×22 (stand + two walk frames
sharing a `deerHead` upper body) — and left variants are `flipH` of the right-facing grids.
Anything drawn through `drawSpriteFlash` must stay within 32×32.

`js/sprites.js` has a UTF-8 BOM and one heart row that repairs a mangled byte via
`'...'.replace('о', 'g')`. Preserve the file's encoding when editing — re-saving it as something
else will corrupt the grids.
